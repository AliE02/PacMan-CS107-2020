# PacMan-CS107-2020
 Medium size project done during our first programing class "Intro to Programing-CS107" in which we learned basic concepts of object oriented programming and Java

## Start the game
 - navigate to the Play.java file located at the path java/ch/epfl/cs107/play and run the main function of that file.
 
## Game instructions
 - After having passed the first two levels, eating diamonds and cherries and escaping ghosts, you have to eat the boss, the faster ghost, which you will encounter in the third level...
 - Note that if you have 0 HP you lose and the game is ended.
 
## The Commands 
 - (not that if we don’t press a direction button, the player will go in a straight line (except in case of collision with a wall)
 - To control Pacman, use the direction keys of your keyboard.

## Game instructions
 - You have to successfully find the key at each of the four levels of the game, and open all doors in order to win. You have 5 lives that you will lose of you collide with one of the ghosts.

### Level 0
 - Is a simple introductory level where the key is visible from the start and no ghosts are there to bother you.

### Level 1
 - Is a harder variation where the key is hidden until you eat 550 diamonds (blue dots). This time, there will be ghosts who will follow you and try to kill you.

### Level 2
 - Is an even harder variation with more ghosts and more keys to find.

### Bonus level
 - It's a bonus... :)
 
## The positive entities: 
 - Cherries: gives you +200 points once collected
 - Diamonds: gives you +10 points once collected
